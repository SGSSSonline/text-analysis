    "\n",
    "Computational methods are transforming research practice across the disciplines. For social scientists these methods offer a number of valuable opportunities, including creating new datasets from digital sources; unearthing new insights and avenues for research from existing data sources; and improving the accuracy and efficiency of fundamental research activities.\n",

    "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have become one of the most important ways to access and transfer data online (Bail, 2021). There are a number of advantages to using APIs instead of web-scraping, in particular avoiding many of the legal or ethical issues associated with the latter. However APIs can use data formats and structures that are alien to researchers in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, and can enact access barriers of their own (e.g., subscriptions and fees for using the API, rate limits).\n",

    "It performs this role by providing a set of protocols/standards for making *requests* and formulating *responses* between applications. For example, a smart phone application might need real-time traffic data from an online database. An API can validate the application's request for data, and handle the online database's response (i.e., the transfer of data to the application). In the absence of an API, the smart phone application would need to know a lot more technical information about the online database in order to communicate with it (e.g., what commands does the database understand?). But thanks to the API, the smart phone application only needs to know how to formulate a request that the API understands, which then communicates the request to the database and handles the response."

Often they deposit their data to a data portal - e.g., <a href=\"https://data.gov.uk/\" target=_blank>UK Government Open Data</a> -, allowing you to download the files as and when needed. However, another approach they can adopt is to allow access to the underlying information that is stored in their database through an API. Using this method, individuals can send a customised *request* for information to the database; if the request is valid, the database *responds* by providing you with the information you asked for. Think of using an API as the difference between downloading a raw data file which then needs to be filtered to arrive at the information you need, and performing the filtering when you request the data, so only what you need is returned."

    "Interacting with an API is a simple yet powerful computational method for collecting data of value for social science research. It provides a relatively gentle introduction to using programming languages, also. However, \"with great power comes great responsibility\" (sorry). APIs take you into the realm of data protection, Terms of Service/Use, and many murky ethical issues. Wielded sensibly and sensitively, collecting data from APIs is a valuable and exciting social science research method.\n",
